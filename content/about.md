Brain Dump is my collection of notes written as a reference for future me. It is intended to be mostly about Go, Google Cloud and Terraform, but I may occationally venture into deeper water, learning things totally new to me. The notes will be crude. Most of the posts probably only half finished. Sometimes the truth will be omitted to simplify things.
